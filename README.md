# Django core tasks

A basic reference implementation of background workers and tasks in Django, intended to go along with [the background workers DEP](https://github.com/django/deps/pull/86). It serves as more fully-fledged examples of what an implementation might look like.

**Warning**: This code is not intended to be installed, let alone deployed to production!
